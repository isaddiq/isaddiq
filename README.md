# 👋 Hi, I'm Saddiq Ur Rehman

🎓 PhD Candidate | 🏗️ BIM & XR Researcher | 🧠 AI + AEC Innovator  
📍 Dept. of Architecture, Kyung Hee University, South Korea  
🌐 Passionate about Modular Construction, 4D BIM, Mixed Reality, and Intelligent Design Automation

## 🔍 About Me

I am a PhD candidate specializing in immersive technologies and data-driven design for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. My research integrates **Building Information Modeling (BIM)** with **XR platforms (VR, MR)**, **AI-driven tools**, and **real-time simulations**, particularly focused on **modular construction workflows**.

Currently, I’m developing interactive frameworks that:

- Simulate **4D BIM workflows** inside Unity
- Enable **bidirectional BIM data exchange** between Revit and Unity (via my plugin **ReUniXchange**)
- Leverage **LLMs and voice interaction** for smarter design and inspection in MR
- Align **digital twins with physical modules** for DfMA verification

## 🧩 Projects & Research Highlights

### 🔧 ReUniXchange – A Bidirectional BIM ↔ Unity Bridge  
**Keywords:** Revit Plugin, Unity Runtime, BIM Metadata, FBX, CSV, JSON  
A custom plugin system enabling semantic-enriched 3D model export from Revit into Unity, preserving metadata and element hierarchy for immersive visualization and interaction.

- ✨ Supports async export/import of model geometry and IFC-like metadata
- 🔁 Enables dynamic updates in both directions
- 🧠 Designed for integration with voice commands and XR inspection tools

### 🏭 Modular Factory 4D BIM VR  
**Keywords:** Construction Simulation, XR Toolkit, First-Person Navigation  
Unity-based VR environment simulating the complete prefabrication process of modular units in a factory, with user-triggered phases and AI optimization for scheduling.

- 📦 Includes phases: Framing, MEP, Enclosure, Finishes, QC, Site Delivery
- ⏱️ Timeline-driven 4D BIM process with user control
- 👁️ First-person immersive walkthrough with phase-by-phase visibility

### 🗣️ Voice-Activated AEC Assistant in MR  
**Keywords:** Azure, Whisper, GPT, BIM Metadata, Voice UI  
A Mixed Reality assistant that allows users to interact with BIM components using natural language, combining LLMs (ChatGPT), STT (Whisper), and TTS (Azure).

- 🎤 Ask questions about selected components (e.g., materials, inspections)
- 🧭 Navigate, inspect, and simulate using speech commands
- 🔍 Integrates seamlessly with ReUniXchange metadata

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

- **Languages:** C#, Python, JavaScript
- **XR Development:** Unity (XR Toolkit, URP, MRTK), OpenXR, Oculus SDK  
- **BIM Tools:** Revit API, Dynamo, IFC, Navisworks, ArchiCAD 
- **Data & Semantics:** JSON, CSV, IFC schema, Ontology Design  
- **AI/ML Tools:** Whisper, ChatGPT API, Azure TTS/STT, Transformers  
- **Other:** Git, GitHub Actions, Visual Studio, VS Code
